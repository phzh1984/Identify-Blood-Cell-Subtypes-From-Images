# Identify-Blood-Cell-Subtypes-From-Images

Basophil vs Eosinophil vs Lymphocyte vs Monocyte vs Neutrophil

Mononuclear (Basophil + Lymphocyte vs Monocyte) vs Polynuclear (Neutrophil + Eosinophil)

An important issue in blood diagnostics involves classifying different types of blood cells. In this dataset, we possess 410 original images and 12,500 augmented images of blood cells, each paired with subtype labels (Basophil vs Eosinophil vs Lymphocyte vs Monocyte vs Neutrophil). Our objective is to automatically classify each image according to the subtype of cells it contains.
